Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to our project! 💖

If anything doesn't make sense, or doesn't work when you run it, please open a bug report and let us know!

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

* Typo fixes
* Improvement fixes (especially readability)
* New additional asks
* Other things that might help progress this :)

## Ask for Help
The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on the original github issue

## Pull Request Lifecycle
For those familiar with Git(Hub) please fork the repo, make a branch, and then reference it as a ticket/issue here.

For those unfamiliar, I think you can do something easier via the web interface, but I'm not too sure… if in doubt, just create an Issue, and put what you think should change there.

## Development Environment Setup
This should just be Markdown files, so you'll want an editor that works for MarkDown.

A variety of tools exist. I use VSCode (it's probably overkill for simple changes). A basic text editor like `Notepad` can work with Markdown. 

If you're new to Markdown, the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) may be helpful.


## Styleguide
To help keep content from multiple editors consistent, this styleguide is defined:

 * [Inclusive](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation) and gender-neutral language; `you`, `they`, `them`, `theirs`
 * [Oxford spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling) `en-GB-oxendict` (or `en-CA` (Candian) for broader support) 
    * e.g.
      * `-ize` ending (where gramatically correct) 
        * The Oxford use of `‑ize` does not extend to the spelling of words not traced to the Greek `‑izo`, `‑izein` suffixes. One group of such words is those ending in `‑lyse`, such as `analyse`, `paralyse` and `catalyse` … `‑lyse` is the more etymological spelling. Others include `advertise`, `arise`, `compromise`, `chastise`, `disguise`, `improvise`, `prise` (in the sense of open), and `televise`.
      * 'additional' `u`s like in `colour`
    * Please be consistent with existing spellings
 * [Oxford commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)
 * List items shouldn't have a period (`.`) at the end of them, apart from the last item.

 > 🥽 Watch out for spacing after `#` signs (headings) &mdash; make sure they render properly (use the preview mode in your editor, if it has one).

## Pull Request Checklist
When you submit your pull request, or you push new commits to it, automated systems might run some checks on your new code. Your pull request should pass these checks.

We also have more criteria than just that before we can
accept and merge it, usually a "does this help" test.
